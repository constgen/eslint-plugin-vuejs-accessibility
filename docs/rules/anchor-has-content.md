# anchor-has-content

Enforce that anchors have content and that the content is accessible to screen readers. Accessible means that it is not hidden using the `aria-hidden` prop. Refer to the references to learn about why this is important.

## Rule details

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vuejs-accessibility/anchor-has-content": [
      "error",
      {
        "components": ["Anchor"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For the `components` option, these strings determine which elements (**always including** `<a>`) should be checked for having content. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `a` element.

### Succeed

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```vue
<a>Anchor Content!</a>
<a><TextWrapper /><a>
<a is="TextWrapper" />
<a v-text="msg" />
<a v-html="msg" />
```

### Fail

```vue
<a /> <a><TextWrapper aria-hidden /></a>
```
